Flashlights programming process to play the difusion rule.

The board is constructed with Cubelets Robots: 36 flashlights (board 6x6). Each change 1000 miliseconds.

Each folder contains the codes used for the cubelets used. If you wish to use them, you must change the serial numbers according to your own arrangement. It is also important to be careful when placing them, otherwise inconsistent results will occur.

Note: it should work so the change is continuous and works as if the board were infinite, but in testing, it truncates at the walls.
